      <p class="how-to">
        <br />
        <br />
        Tic-tac-toe is played on a three-by-three grid by two players, who
        alternately place the marks X and O in one of the nine spaces in the
        grid.<br />
        <br />
        There is no universally-agreed rule as to who plays first, but in this
        article the convention that X plays first is used. Players soon discover
        that the best play from both parties leads to a draw. Hence, tic-tac-toe
        is often played by young children who may not have discovered the
        optimal strategy. Because of the simplicity of tic-tac-toe, it is often
        used as a pedagogical tool for teaching the concepts of good
        sportsmanship and the branch of artificial intelligence that deals with
        the searching of game trees. It is straightforward to write a computer
        program to play tic-tac-toe perfectly or to enumerate the 765
        essentially different positions (the state space complexity) or the
        26,830 possible games up to rotations and reflections (the game tree
        complexity) on this space. If played optimally by both players, the game
        always ends in a draw, making tic-tac-toe a futile game.<br />
        <br />
        The game can be generalized to an m,n,k-game, in which two players
        alternate placing stones of their own color on an m-by-n board with the
        goal of getting k of their own color in a row. Tic-tac-toe is the
        3,3,3-game. Harary's generalized tic-tac-toe is an even broader
        generalization of tic-tac-toe. It can also be generalized as an nd game,
        specifically one in which n equals 3 and d equals 2. It can be
        generalised even further by playing on an arbitrary incidence structure,
        where rows are lines and cells are points. Tic-tac-toe's incidence
        structure consists of nine points, three horizontal lines, three
        vertical lines, and two diagonal lines, with each line consisting of at
        least three points.<br /><br />
